The sinewave generation circuit incorporates an 
analog multiplexer (mux), a counter, and an operational amplifier (opamp) to generate a sinusoidal waveform with a digitally controlled 
frequency. A counter is used in the circuit to generate a digital signal, 
which is then fed into an analog mux to generate a series of 
analog voltage levels. To generate a clean and reliable output signal, 
an op-amp is utilized as a buffer and amplifier. The output frequency 
of the circuit can be varied by adjusting the frequency of the counter. 
This approach offers a low-cost and straightforward solution for 
creating a sinusoidal waveform with exact frequency control
